# COLACOLA-DASHBOARD
This project marks my first step into data storytelling an interactive Excel dashboard analyzing Coca-Colaâ€™s 2022 sales performance. I explored quarterly sales, regional performance, and product profitability to uncover key business insights.



Dataset

Source: Synthetic dataset created for practice(kaggle)

Scope: Sales transactions across different regions and products in 2022

Preparation: Data cleaning, aggregation, and transformation in Excel before building the dashboard




Tools & Technologies

Excel: PivotTables, Charts, Dashboard Design




Key Insights

Q1: 17.25% of total sales, a modest start setting the stage for growth

Q2: Climbed to 23.81%, reflecting seasonal demand and stronger campaigns

Q3: Peaked at 30.54%, becoming the best-performing quarter, likely driven by back-to-school promotions, increased retail activity, and summer holidays

Q4: Closed at 28.40%, rounding off the year with solid festive season sales



Regionally, the West led in total sales
Coca-Cola (the classic drink) was the best-selling and most profitable product, consistently outperforming others
The highest sales growth occurred between Q1 and Q3, showing a strong mid-year strategic lift
